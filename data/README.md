# ADS Project 1:  R Notebook on the Presidential Elections in the US

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.


#NOTE---because the data file is so large, because I chose to use the entire dataset, I am unable to unload directly--must unzip. Because of that, my script uses an absolute path. You will have to download the file and unzip (extract all) on your computer. Apologies for any inconvenience.
